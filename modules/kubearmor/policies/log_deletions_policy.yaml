# Description
#
# Adversaries may delete or modify artifacts generated within systems to remove
# evidence of their presence or hinder defenses. Various artifacts may be created
# by an adversary or something that can be attributed to an adversaryâ€™s actions.
# Typically these artifacts are used as defensive indicators related to monitored events,
# such as strings from downloaded files, logs that are generated from user actions,
# and other data analyzed by defenders. Location, format, and type of artifact
# (such as command or login history) are often specific to each platform.

# Attack Scenario
#
# It's important to note that removal of indicators related to intrusion
# activity may interfere with event collection, reporting, or other processes used
# to detect such activity. This can compromise the integrity of security solutions
# by causing notable events to go unreported. Additionally, this activity
# may impede forensic analysis and incident response, due to a lack of sufficient
# data to determine what occurred. It's crucial to ensure that all relevant
# indicators are properly monitored and reported to prevent such issues from occurring.
# Attack Type Integrity Threats, Data Manipulation Actual Attack NetWalker, Conti, DarkSide RaaS
