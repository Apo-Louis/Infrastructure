# Description
#
# Exfiltration consists of techniques that adversaries may use to steal data
# from your network. Once theyâ€™ve collected data, adversaries often package it
# to avoid detection while removing it. This can include compression and encryption.
# Techniques for getting data out of a target network typically include
# transferring it over their command and control channel or an alternate channel
# and may also include putting size limits on the transmission.

# Attack Scenario
#
# It's important to note that file copy tools can be leveraged by attackers for
# exfiltrating sensitive data and transferring malicious payloads into the workloads.
# Additionally, it can also assist in lateral movement within the system.
# It's crucial to take proactive measures to prevent these attacks from occurring.
# Attack Type Credential Access, Lateral movements, Information Disclosure
# Actual Attack DarkBeam Data Breach, Shields Health Care Group data breach
